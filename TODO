=head1 TODO List

=head2 Advanced searching

I'm already using AbstractSearch, so I need to put the operators as form
fields in the templates, then extract them again in the search method.
The code is almost there.

=head2 Ordering of columns

What order do the columns appear in the lists and edit boxes? It B<is>
already possible to customize this by overriding C<columns> in an
individual model class, but it might be better to do that in the config.

Excluding some columns from list display might be worth doing. Again, it
can be done in the templates, but might be better in config.

=head2 Pages with several ?(different kinds) of objects?

I don't know if this is actually a useful concept. Maybe someone will
find a case for it.

=head2 ACLs? Users? Last-updated?

Probably not. These are handled in subclasses

=head2 Error handling

When happens if authentication is denied, for instance? Currently we
just get an Apache 403.

=head2 Many-to-many relationships

Beers are on pumps in pubs. How do I say which pubs have what beers on
and vice versa? A multiple select seems the right way to do it from the
CGI point of view, so we need to do something with edit, create, search
and view pages to enable this. Maybe another C<related>-style hack
required.
